Introduction    

This dataset includes a table of identifications, "2006ja012023-ts01.txt", for 2808 telluric emission lines originating in the terrestrial nightglow observed by Hanuschik [2003] with the UVES spectrograph on the VLT Kueyen 8 meter Telescope, Cerro Paranal, Chile.  Identifications were made by comparison of the origin spectra of the atlas with model spectra of various nightglow emission systems. This file corresponds to an expanded version of Table 3 listed in the paper. A table of model transitions against which the atlas line list was screened is provided in "2006ja012023-ts02.txt". The origin spectra of the    atlas, transformed into units of wavelength and intensity commonly employed in aeronomy are provided in tables "2006ja012023-ts03.txt" through "2006ja012023-ts08.txt". A text file "2006ja012023-text09.txt" describes in greater detail the structure and nomenclature used within all of the tables, and is included as part of this supplement.

1. 2006ja012023-ts01.txt List of identifications for the 2808 nightglow emission features observed by Hanuschik [2003].  Up to four identifications are listed for each feature, with each identification listed as a separate record with the same observational attributes, in order of decreasing model line intensity.  This is an expanded version of Table 3 from the manuscript. 1.1 Column "obs_lam", nm, observed air wavelength of feature. 1.2 Column "FWHM", nm, observed full-width-at-half-maximum of feature. 1.3 Column "peak_int", Rayleighs/nm, observed peak intensity of feature. 1.4 Column "cpeak_int", Rayleighs/nm, calculated peak intensity after subtraction of continuum level determined by spline fit to the spectrum. 1.5 Column "osp", origin spectra in which the feature appears. 1.6 Column "ind", reference number to observed feature from original observation.  Numbers increase with wavelength and resets at beginning of each origin spectrum. 1.7 Column "ia", indicates if the identification comes from and atomic species (ia=1) or molecular species (ia=0). 1.8 Column "tn", a label specifying the nature of the identifications for a particular feature ("U","S","L","B","M") and number of identification for that observed feature. See   explanation for labels in article and in "2006-ja012023-text09.txt" 1.9 Column "ID", a label for the transition used as an identification for the observed feature.  Label structure varies depending upon whether the identification comes from an atomic or molecular species.  See "2006-ja012023-text09.txt" for an explicit discussion of this structure. 1.10 Column "id_lam", nm, the air wavelength of the identifying transition. 1.11 Column "lam_dif", nm, the observed wavelength for the feature "obs_lam" minus the calculated wavelength for the
    identifying transition "id_lam". 1.12 Column "id_int", Rayleighs/nm, the modeled peak intensity for the identifying transition. Comparable to the observed peak intensity after subtraction of fitted continuum "cpeak_int". 

2. 2006ja012023-ts02.txt A table of model identifications matched against features in the atlas and used to make identifications, listed in increasing wavelength order, with their calculated peak intensities. 2.1 Column "id_lam", nm, the air wavelength of the model transition. Same as Column "id_lam" in "2006ja012023-ts01.txt". 2.2 Column "id_int", Rayleighs/nm, the model transition peak intensity.  Same as Column "id_int" in "2006-ja012023-ts01.txt". 2.3 Column "id_label", the identification label for the transition, same as Column "ID" from "2006-ja012023-ts01.txt".
