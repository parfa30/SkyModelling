# SkyModelling
This git repo contains code to analyze the sky spectrum measured by BOSS and others. The primary goal is to create a model for the sky continuum and OH line emissions.

This repo is a collaboration between Parker Fagrelius, Anze Slocum, and David Kirkby and could grow to include more people.

Included in this repo:
* spframe_flux.py: Run to collect sky flux for all BOSS data. Turns spframe electrons into flux
* good_plates.txt: Includes QUALITY data for every plate-day from platelist.fits for BOSS data
* sky_fibers.pkl: Includes each sky fiber identified for each BOSS plate
* BOSSFluxData.ipynb: Python notebook that extracts data generated by spframe_flux and loads it all in a pd.DataFrame
